# 💼 Portfolio Website Project

Welcome to my portfolio website project!

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website built using HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, and Material Icons.  
The design follows a **mobile-first** approach, focusing on clean UI, smooth animations, and user-friendly navigation.

## ✨ Features

-  📐 Clean and minimalistic layout
-  📱 Fully responsive design optimized for all screen sizes
-  ⚡ Smooth scroll and interactive animations
-  🧩 Uses Tailwind CSS 4.1, Flowbite components, and Material Icons
-  🔍 Semantic HTML5 and accessible markup
-  ⚠️ Some breakpoint issues encountered due to Flowbite CDN and Tailwind CLI integration,  
   which I resolved by using `max-sm:` style utilities in certain places.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-  Tailwind CSS 4.1
-  Flowbite UI components
-  Material Icons & Material Symbols
